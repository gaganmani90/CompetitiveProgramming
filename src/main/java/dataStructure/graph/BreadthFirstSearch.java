/**
 * Breadth First Traversal (or Search) for a graph is similar to Breadth First Traversal of a tree (See method 2 of this post).
 * The only catch here is, unlike trees, graphs may contain cycles, so we may come to the same node again.
 * To avoid processing a node more than once, we use a boolean visited array. For simplicity, it is assumed that all vertices are reachable from the starting vertex.
 * For example, in the following graph, we start traversal from vertex 2.
 * When we come to vertex 0, we look for all adjacent vertices of it. 2 is also an adjacent vertex of 0.
 * If we donâ€™t mark visited vertices, then 2 will be processed again and it will become a non-terminating process.
 * A Breadth First Traversal of the following graph is 2, 0, 3, 1.
