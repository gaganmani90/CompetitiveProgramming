==String==
1. Given a string, determine if it can be reassigned to be a palindrome
2. Find if one string is "oneEditAway" from another string
3. From a list of words create a list of buckets with anagrams in the same bucket
4.  design a system to detect homeworking copying, which means input two strings and a integer K,
if there is a common substring of them have length larger than K, return true, else return false.
5. Given an vector<string> (e.g ['cc', 'ca', 'bc']) and a dictionary order (e.g. ['c', 'b', 'a']).
To decide whether the given vector<string> is sorted or not.
6. Given a list of words for example : cat,bat,rat.... and given a query which has a special character '.' which can be represented as any alphabet between 'a-z'. Write a function which gives true as output if the the query is in the list of words.
Example: List of words: cat,bat,rat,cct,cut Query 1: c.t Output 1 : true Query 2: c.. output 2 : true
7. write a program that solves linear equations with - + and * operators given as strings.
For example the input can be: "8+5+x+3*x = 10-x+4*3*x"
8. You have a log file. Find the k most frequent entries in the log file.

==Tree==
1. Find lowest common ancestors of a tree given nodes.
2. Vertical tree traversal
3. Find the longest distance between any two nodes in a binary tree.

==Array==
1. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
2. Find intersection of 2 sorted arrays.
3. Move all non-zero elements into the front of array.
4. Given a matrix, calculate the sum of a sub matrix given the start and end indices of the submatrix
5. Triplet sum in array
6. Determine the consecutive elements in the array that sum to the target value.
7. Find longest increasing subarray in a given array

==Linked List==
1. Reverse a linked list single and doubly

==Stack==
1. Parenthesis question

==Misc==
1. for a random-ordered bucket of numbers 1 through 3000 with one number missing,
how would you detect which number is missing?
